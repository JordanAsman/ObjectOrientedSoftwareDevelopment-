# Twelve Problems

This exercise will let you practice your algorithmic skills from 120
in a new Java context.
 
You will do this exercise by yourself.

# What to do

1. Download this project (TwelveProblems) from Moodle (under __Assignment Resources__) and import into eclipse
2. Fill in the missing functions in TwelveProblems.java
3. Run the included unit tests to ensure you solution works 
4. Submit your code via Moodle assignment

# Rubric

Each problem is worth 5 points.

Total possible: 60 points.

The problems themselves are already reasonably documented --- don't
worry about writing Javadocs on this program but do keep your code
clean, well formatted, and understandable.

# Notes

The specification of each of the problems is in the TwelveProblems
code as comments. Write each of the 12 functions in that file. To
solve the problems, you will likely have to look up details in your
textbook -- not every function you will need is covered in class. The
problems have notes indicating what constructs are required to solve
them.

All the problems have unit tests which can run to ensure your solution
works as expected. Do run the unit tests to help check
yourself. However, the unit tests are not designed to be exhaustive -
your code has to be correct for all inputs, even ones not specified in
the unit tests

# How to submit
You should find instructions
on how to submit [here](../../Docs/submitting_code.html).
