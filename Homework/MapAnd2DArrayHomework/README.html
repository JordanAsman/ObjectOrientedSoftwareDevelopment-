<h1 id="map-and-2d-array-homework">Map and 2D Array Homework</h1>
<p>This exercise will let you practice using 2D arrays and hashmaps on a more challenging set of problems.</p>
<p>You will do this exercise yourself <em>except</em> if you like you can find a partner and collaborate on exactly 1 of the problems. Note in your comments which problem you collaborated on and who you collaborated with.</p>
<h1 id="what-to-do">What to do</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li>Download this project (MapAnd2DArrayHomework) from Moodle (under <strong>Assignment Resources</strong>) and import into eclipse</li>

</ul>
