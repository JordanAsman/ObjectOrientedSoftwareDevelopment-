Reflection Questions:

1.A In your implementation could you replace Questions with Strings (yes or no)? 

	No.

1.B Why or why not? (2-3 sentences)

	Two array lists would be needed to get the question id and the question. However, updating the question would not work if this was the case.

2.A. What data type did you use to represent the 1 to many relationship between QuizMain and Question? (provide type)
	
	An ArrayList of Questions.

2.B. What is another type could you have used? (provide type) 
	
	A HashMap with question number as keys and questions as values.

2.C. Would that have made the code better or worse? Why? (2-3 sentences)

	Yes. A hashmap would have simplified the code. It would have also made it more efficient.
