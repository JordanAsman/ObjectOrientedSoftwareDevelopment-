Reflection Questions:

1. Compare your original draft and the final draft. What is the biggest difference between the two?

I ended up doing a lot of the calculations in the main class instead of in the question, quiz, and quiz tester classes.

2. What did you have to change and why did you have to change it? If not, explain how you made your decisions in designing.

I did a lot of the calculations in the main class simply because my code would not function how I wanted it to when it was not in the main class.

3. Did you re-use your code from ImplementingDesign1? How much did you have to change it if so? (If not, then please explain why)

I reused a decent amount of my code from ImplementingDesign1. I had to update them a little so they would include boolean answers.

4. Select one or more specific design principles and discuss how they relate to the your experience in designing and implementing the code for this assignment.

I tried not to repeat code by calling already created methods whenever possible.
